Need to make a strong argument for why what we are looking into is important:
Talk with mike...
1. Proof of concept
2. Emergent behavior
3. Responsive to ballot features that do indeed make things harder for voters, so we are! identifying known bad ballots features, and moreover we are identifying! new bad ballot features --> will work on new ballots.

Run again with more trials? --> deffinetely need to write trial numbers somewhere
Explain future of grouping
